	<h2>Installation</h2>
	<p>Download the tar ball, and extract all the contents into the folder where your website will be hosted from. Your databaseconnection might be different from the current one in the files. This connection information to your database should be provided by your website host. The following files will need to be updated:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>PHPconnectionDB_final.pjp</li>
			<li>add_person_confirmation</li>
			<li>admin_output.php</li>
			<li>getImage.php</li>
			<li>getImageThumb.php</li>
			<li>groupManipulation.php</li>
			<li>group_registration_confirmation.php</li>
			<li>image_gallery.php</li>
			<li>registerconfirmation</li>
			<li>remove_person_confirmation.php</li>
			<li>updatePhotoConfirmation.php</li>
			<li>upload.php</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Also make sure to have php installed on your hosted site, at least PHP 5 or above, since we use that as our minimum. You may have to ask your respective web master.</p>
	<h2>Login</h2>
	<p> If you would like to register a user account, click register from the login page, and fill in the appropriate information.
		You will receive an alert if any necessary information is not entered. When signing in make sure you information is correct!
	</p>
	<h2>Uploading photos</h2>
	<p>While uploading photos, only gif or jpeg/jpg files will be accepted by the server. So make sure your desired image is in that format. While uploading you cannot leave the image blank or not uploaded. You will know that the image was successfully uploaded by the helpful message and you can also see that image in your photos. </p>

	<h2>Group Management</h2>
	<p>You may be having trouble adding users to your own groups, and removing them from them as well. You have to make sure that the username of the person you would like to add/remove exists as a user on the site. You will break a check that makes sure the users being added exist int the database.</p>

	<p> Thanks again for using our site for your photo image management and if none of this helps, please contact us at gd1@ualberta.ca</p>
